Notes: 
~~~~~
1.	The data sources used do not provide full coverage of the screening facts for the zip3 
geographical area, therefore, only the ratio can be used for inference of the positivity rates in the area. 
2.	The average values of Longitude and Latitude were calculated based on 2018 ODS dataset: https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/us-zip-code-latitude-and-longitude/information/
